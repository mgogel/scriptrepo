### Apple Contacts cleanup tool. Cleans birthdays and Facebooks from contact cards.

Tired of screwed-up Contacts cards with Facebook profile links?

Annoyed with getting notifications every day that won't go away about so-and-so's birthday?

If you've ever synced your Contacts with Facebook, there's a chance that you got a really screwed up Contacts as a result. This will help you clean up your Contacts.

## Three tools

1. Delete all birthdays (so they don't pop up in Mac/iPhone and stay there)
2. Delete all Facebook fields
3. Delete all Homepages for people that start with "fb://"

## How to use it

1. BACKUP YOUR CONTACTS! File > Export > Contacts Archive...
2. Download the [ZIP of this repository](https://github.com/markbao/neat-contacts/archive/master.zip) and run `neat-contacts.scpt`, or copy [`neat-contacts.applescript`](https://github.com/markbao/neat-contacts/raw/master/neat-contacts.applescript) into an AppleScript Editor window.
3. Figure out for which people you want to make the change. You can leave it as it is to change everyone, or you can do it for a specific person (maybe to test it).
4. Decide which of these tools you want to use.
5. For the tools that you don't want to use, simply delete them.
6. Run the script.
